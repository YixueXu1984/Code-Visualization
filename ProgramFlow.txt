This is the overall flow for our viz:

-User places a java project into the /in directory
-User specifies main file path in /in/mainFile.txt

-Run cpsc410-viz
    -Runner.run()
        -calls inject()
            -injects logging code into all .java files inside /in
            -places these into /out/injected
        -compiles all /out/injected .java files
        -runs injected version, injected lines record data
        -data written to /out/analyzed
        -graphViz is run on /out/analyzed function
